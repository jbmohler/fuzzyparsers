The intent of the fuzzyparsers library is to provide a central place for functions to sanitize free form user input.
Read the doc-strings for more information about this library.

Fuzzyparsers is written by Joel B. Mohler and distributed under the terms of the GPL v3 (or later).

The doc-tests provide fair code coverage.  Use the following command::

    python -m doctest fuzzyparsers/*.py

To install fuzzyparsers, do the normal python thing (probably as root)::

    python setup.py install
